# Gravitational Wave sample set
These are gravitational wave samples which originally were prepared by the LIGO/Virgo consortium on this [website](https://www.gw-openscience.org/audiogwtc1/) under the CC-BY 4.0 licence.  
We have cut the files somewhat which you find in the `gw_cut` folder. These versions are better suited for the use in live coding situations, where shorter samples can be modified better. The other two folder contain the original files.

## to do
- [ ] apply filter to the cutted samples in order to exclude some blip and other noises

## licences
These samples are modified versions of the data published by `R. Abbott et al. (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration), "Open data from the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo", SoftwareX 13 (2021) 100658.` which was originally licensed under a
